## HOW-TO-USE

The "main.py" file is utilised to Load, Clean, Transform, Design, Style, and Visualise the data through the library of functions in src/.

Presets for axes data, titles, graph types, index columns, dataset filepath, and excluded data are all located in **config/presets.yaml**. You can create your own preset and then switch to it at the bottom of __main.py__.

Other than that, colour palettes can also be modified through **config/config.py** and you can look at different palettes at -> [Seaborn Colour Palettes](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/properties.html)

The src/ functions will be carried over to each new Data Science Project I make, allowing more features and configurations.

## PLANNED FEATURES
*these 'planned features' may be introduced in later projects other than this one*

- ~~Plot Presets~~
- Linear Extrapolation (Prediction)
- Summary Statistics
- Box Plot of Displayed Graph
- Jupyter Notebook eventually??

##

*I don't plan to make much more additions to this project other than creating ~~presets~~ for main.py.*
