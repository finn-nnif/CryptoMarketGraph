## HOW-TO-USE

The "main.py" file is utilised to Load, Clean, Transform, Design, Style, and Visualise the data through the library of functions in src/.

The src/ functions will be carried over to each new Data Science Project I make, allowing more features and configurations.

## PLANNED FEATURES
*these 'planned features' may be introduced in later projects other than this one*

- Plot Presets
- Linear Extrapolation (Prediction)
- Summary Statistics
- Box Plot of Displayed Graph
- Jupyter Notebook eventually??

##

*I don't plan to make much more additions to this project other than creating presets for main.py.*
